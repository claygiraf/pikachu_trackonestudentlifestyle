## 👾 Problem Statement
Problem Statement: Mental Health Support for Students
Many university students face mounting stress, anxiety, and loneliness due to academic pressure and life transitions. Studies show that **over 60% of college students report experiencing overwhelming anxiety** during their studies, yet many do not seek help. Without accessible coping tools or support systems, these challenges often go unnoticed until they severely impact well-being and academic performance. WithU addresses this by:
- Providing **AI-assisted mood tracking and journaling** with **personalized responses** and **weekly detection of negative patterns** to build self-awareness.
- Offering **gamified goal achievement** through **avatar rewards** and **smart goal suggestions** for sustainable personal growth.
- Delivering **24/7 crisis support** with **one-tap hotline access** and **guided self-help tools** to ensure timely intervention.
- Ensuring **inclusive accessibility** so **all users**, including those with **disabilities**, can access **equal mental health support**.
